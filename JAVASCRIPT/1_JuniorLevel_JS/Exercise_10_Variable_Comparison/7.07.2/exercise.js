// # Exercise 10

// * Explain the difference between the double and the triple equals operator.

// const firstYearCompleted = true;
// const yearsCompleted = 1;

// yearsCompleted == firstYearCompleted
// yearsCompleted === firstYearCompleted


const firstYearCompleted = true;
const yearsCompleted = 1;

yearsCompleted == firstYearCompleted // True, because the double equal doesn`t need to be exactly the same, but "true" is equal to "1" in binary language
yearsCompleted === firstYearCompleted // False, isn't exactly the same

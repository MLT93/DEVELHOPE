# Exercise 15

Create a variable called `age` and assign it a numeric value. Use the Conditional (ternary) operator. If the variable is grater or equal to 18, print `You can drive a car`. If the variable is less than 18, print `You are too young to drive`.

let age = 22;
console.log(age >= 18 ? `You can drive a car` : `You are too young to drive`)

let age2 = 15;
age2 >= 18 ? console.log("You can drive a car") : console.log("You are too young to drive")

let edad = 999;
edad >= 18 ? "You can drive a car" : "You are too young to drive"
console.log (variableEdad)
